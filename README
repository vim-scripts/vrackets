Vrackets helps you a lot by auto-closing the brackets you type.
For instance, if you type "(", you get:
    (|)
("|" is the cursor.)
You can easily get out of the brackets by typing the closing bracket. If after that you type ")", you get:
    ()|
Lastly, brackets are auto-deleted if they are empty. For instance, if your screen looks like this:
    FooBar(|)
And you press backspace, you get this:
    FooBar

By default it works for (), [] and {}. It also works for ¡! and ¿?, for spanish speakers ;).
You can add more easily if you want (like <>, but I wouldn't recommend it unless for html/xml/etc). Note however that quotation marks and other pairs in which the closing symbol is the same as the opening one won't work as expected (yet).
